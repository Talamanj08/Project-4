# Project-4

# Project Question: 
Based on the measurements of the key features of the flower (the petal width and length and the sepal width and length) can we accurately classify an Iris Flower by its species?

# Data Source: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanuss/iris-flower-dataset
- 
# Libraries used: 
- SciKit- Learn
- Python Pandas
 -HTML/CSS
- Flask
- PgAdmin (for the SQL database)
- Tableau
- Joblib

# models we tried: 
- We tried a random forest model with 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 test sizes, but we decided to go with 0.4 since it yielded 98% accuracy, whereas the others yielded 100% accuracy.
- logistic regression 

# model we ended up using and why: 
- random forest

# visuals we did: 
- tableau and in the notebook 

# web interface stuff:
- flask
- html
-
